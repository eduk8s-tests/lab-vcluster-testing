For details of how this workshop demonstrating creation of virtual Kubernetes

* https://github.com/eduk8s-tests/lab-vcluster-testing

Note that this is still a work in progress as some tweaks are still required
to have the virtual Kubernetes cluster work seamlessly within the restricted
RBAC that an Educates session provides, as well as ensuring it is secure.
